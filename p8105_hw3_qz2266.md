The data set has 50400 observations, and contains 6 variables, including
week, day_id, day, day_type, act_minute, act_count. Data was collected
across 35 days of 5 weeks.

There are four date variables :

-   day_id is a integer variable that indicates the day when data was
    collected;
-   day is a factor variable that indicates which day it is when data
    was collected;
-   week is a integer variable that indicates the week when data was
    collected.
-   day_type is a factor variable that indicates the information was
    collected on weekend or weekday.
