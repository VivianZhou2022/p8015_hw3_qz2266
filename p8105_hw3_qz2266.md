# Problem 2

## Load, tidy, and otherwise wrangle the data. Your final dataset should include all originally observed variables and values; have useful variable names; include a weekday vs weekend variable; and encode data with reasonable variable classes. Describe the resulting dataset.

``` r
accel = 
  read_csv("data/accel_data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "act_minute",
    values_to = "act_count") %>%
 
  mutate(
    day_type = case_when(
      day == "Monday" ~ "weekday",
      day == "Tuesday" ~ "weekday",
      day == "Wednesday" ~ "weekday",
      day == "Thursday" ~ "weekday",
      day == "Friday" ~ "weekday",
      day == "Saturday" ~ "weekend",
      day == "Sunday" ~ "weekend" ,
      TRUE     ~ ""
  )) %>%
  
  mutate(
    week = as.integer(week),
    day_id = as.integer(day_id),
    day = factor(day, levels = c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday")),
    day_type = factor(day_type, levels = c("weekday", "weekend"))) %>% 
  relocate(week,day_id, day, day_type)
```

    ## Rows: 35 Columns: 1443
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr    (1): day
    ## dbl (1442): week, day_id, activity.1, activity.2, activity.3, activity.4, ac...
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

The data set has 50400 observations, and contains 6 variables, including
week, day_id, day, day_type, act_minute, act_count. Data was collected
across 35 days of 5 weeks.

There are four date variables :

-   day_id is a integer variable that indicates the day when data was
    collected;
-   day is a factor variable that indicates which day it is when data
    was collected;
-   week is a integer variable that indicates the week when data was
    collected.
-   day_type is a factor variable that indicates the information was
    collected on weekend or weekday.

There are two activity variables :

-   act_minute is a character variable that indicates the minute when
    the activity count was collected, corresponding to each minute of a
    24-hour day starting at midnight.
-   On each day, there are 1440 activity counts for each minute of a
    24-hour day starting at midnight, and the corresponding value is
    stored in act_count, which is a numeric variable.

## Using your tidied dataset, aggregate across minutes to create a total activity variable for each day, and create a table showing these totals.

``` r
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

options(dplyr.summarise.inform = FALSE)

total_act =
  accel %>%
  group_by(week, day) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(total_activity = sum(act_count)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "day", 
    values_from = "total_activity")
```

We couldn’t see any apparent trends over days. However, we could roughly
find that the total activity across 5 weeks is high on Wednesday,
Thursday and Friday, and low in Saturday. The total activity seemed to
peak on Friday but quickly drop to the bottom on Saturday.

More specifically, the total activity sum of Sunday is 1.919213^{6}, of
Saturday is 1.369237^{6}, of Monday is 1.8586991^{6}, of Tuesday is
1.7992382^{6}, of Wednesday is 2.129772^{6}, of Thursday is
2.0911506^{6}, and of Friday is 2.2917106^{6}.

The user is relatively more active at the beginning of the study than
later on. On Saturdays of week 4 and 5, the data were much lower than
the rest. There might be some problem with the measurement, such as
incorrect use of the device.

## Make a single-panel plot to show the 24-hour activity time courses for each day.

### If use time points as the x-axis:

``` r
accel_mean_plot = 
  accel %>%
  separate(act_minute, into = c("activity", "act_min")) %>%
  select(-activity) %>%
  mutate(
    act_min = as.numeric(act_min)) %>%
  group_by(day, act_min) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(avg_count = mean(act_count))

accel_mean_plot %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = act_min, y = avg_count, color = day)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(
    title = "24-hour Average Activity Count by Day",
    x = "Time Course",
    y = "Average Activity Count"
  ) + 
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = c(0, 360, 720, 1080, 1440), 
    labels = c("12AM", "6AM", "12PM", "6PM", "11:59PM"),
    limits = c(0, 1440)
    )
```

![](p8105_hw3_qz2266_files/figure-gfm/accel_mean_plot-1.png)<!-- -->

# Another solution:

``` r
accel_plot = 
  accel %>%
  separate(act_minute, into = c("activity", "act_min")) %>%
  select(-activity) %>%
  mutate(
    act_min = as.numeric(act_min))

accel_plot %>%
  group_by(day_id) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = act_min, y = act_count, color = day)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  
  labs(
    title = "24-hour Activity Count by Day",
    x = "Minute",
    y = "Activity Count"
  )
```

![](p8105_hw3_qz2266_files/figure-gfm/accel_plot-1.png)<!-- -->

From the plot we could see the activity count at most time points are
below 2500.There are three peaks located around 7-8AM, 12PM and 8-9pm.
Especially on Friday, there is an obvious peak around 8-9pm. Moreover,
at nights from 12AM to 5AM, the activity counts are pretty low. It might
be because this time slot is the sleeping hour.

# Problem 3

## Write a description of the dataset, noting the size and structure of the data, describing some key variables, and indicating the extent to which missing data is an issue.

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("ny_noaa")
```

``` r
ny_noaa %>%
  group_by(id) %>%
  summarize(n_obs = n()) 
```

    ## # A tibble: 747 × 2
    ##    id          n_obs
    ##    <chr>       <int>

``` r
# number of rows with missing data
ny_noaa %>% drop_na() %>% nrow()

# number of columns with missing data
sum(is.na(ny_noaa$id))
sum(is.na(ny_noaa$date))
sum(is.na(ny_noaa$prcp))
sum(is.na(ny_noaa$snow))
sum(is.na(ny_noaa$snwd))
sum(is.na(ny_noaa$tmax))
sum(is.na(ny_noaa$tmin))
```

The ny_noaa data set has 2595176 observations, and 7 variables,
including id, date, prcp, snow, snwd, tmax, tmin:

id: Weather station ID date: Date of observation prcp: Precipitation
(tenths of mm) snow: Snowfall (mm) snwd: Snow depth (mm) tmax: Maximum
temperature (tenths of degrees C) tmin: Minimum temperature (tenths of
degrees C)

Data was collected from 1484 weather stations, ranging from 1981-01-01
to 2010-12-31.

There are 1222433 rows with missing data. Among them, 5.6195803 %
missing data for precipitation variable,  
14.689601 % for snowfall, 22.8033089 % for snow depth, 43.7102532 % for
maximum temperature, and 43.7126422 % for minimum temperature.
Therefore, the missing data is an issue, especially for tmax and tmin.

## Do some data cleaning. Create separate variables for year, month, and day. Ensure observations for temperature, precipitation, and snowfall are given in reasonable units. For snowfall, what are the most commonly observed values?

``` r
ny_noaa =
ny_noaa %>% 
  mutate(
  year = lubridate::year(date),
  month = lubridate::month(date),
  day = lubridate::day(date),
  prcp = prcp/10,
  tmin = as.numeric(tmin)/10,
  tmax = as.numeric(tmax)/10
  ) %>% 
  relocate(id, year, month, day) %>% 
  select(-date)
```

``` r
ncol(ny_noaa)
```

    ## [1] 9

``` r
colnames(ny_noaa)
```

    ## [1] "id"    "year"  "month" "day"   "prcp"  "snow"  "snwd"  "tmax"  "tmin"

``` r
ny_noaa %>%
  count(snow) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  top_n(3) 
```

    ## Selecting by n

    ## # A tibble: 3 × 2
    ##    snow       n
    ##   <int>   <int>
    ## 1     0 2008508
    ## 2    NA  381221
    ## 3    25   31022

The most commonly observed values for snowfall are 0, NA and 25.

## Make a two-panel plot showing the average max temperature in January and in July in each station across years. Is there any observable / interpretable structure? Any outliers?

``` r
jan_july = 
  ny_noaa %>%
  mutate(
    month = recode_factor(month,
          "01" = "January",
          "02" = "February",
          "03" = "March",
          "04" = "April",
          "05" = "May",
          "06" = "June",
          "07" = "July",
          "08" = "August",
          "09" = "September",
          "10" = "October",
          "11" = "November",
          "12" = "December"),
    year = as.numeric(year)) %>%
  filter(month %in% c("January", "July"))  %>%
  select(id, month, year, tmax) %>%
  group_by(id, year, month) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(mean_tmax = mean(tmax, na.rm = TRUE))

summary(jan_july)
```

    ##       id                 year           month        mean_tmax

  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + 
  geom_smooth() + 
  labs(title = "Average Max Temperature in January and July ",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Average Max Temperature (C)" ) +
  facet_grid(~month) 
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

    ## Warning: Removed 5970 rows containing non-finite values (stat_smooth).

    ## Warning: Removed 5970 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

**Comments**: Between 1981 and 2010, the average maximum temperature in
January is lower than the one in July (about 0 vs. 25 degree celsius),
which is consistent with the change of season in NY. Moreover, generally
speaking, the average maximum temperature in January of each year seems
vary more than the one in July, across all the weather stations, but the
overall trend is quite similar to each other. As for the outliers, most
of them were located in both positive and negative direction in January,
while those in July appeared mostly in the negative direction.

## Make a two-panel plot showing (i) tmax vs tmin for the full dataset (note that a scatterplot may not be the best option); and (ii) make a plot showing the distribution of snowfall values greater than 0 and less than 100 separately by year

``` r
tmax_tmin_p = 
  ny_noaa %>% 
  filter(tmax != "NA" & tmin != "NA") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tmax, y = tmin)) + 
  geom_hex(bin = 20) +
  geom_smooth(se = F) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  labs(
    title = "NY Max and Min Temperatures (1981-2010)",
    x = "Max Temp (°C)",
    y = "Min Temp (°C)"
  )
